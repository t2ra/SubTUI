# SubTUI

**SubTUI** is a lightweight TUI music player for Subsonic-compatible servers (Navidrome, Gonic, Airsonic, etc.) built with Go and the Bubble Tea framework. It uses `mpv` as the underlying audio engine supporting multiple audio formats. It supports scrobbeling ensuring your play counts are updated on your server and on any external services configured like Last.FM or ListenBrainz
